I want to become a front-end developer. According to my studying experience i think i can achieve good results. Before i worked for 3 years as economist so i think have enough patience to study and "mathimatical thinking".
I tried to learn **HTML** and **Css** about 5 years ago, but now i have not a huge amount of knowledge in this language. Also i have basic **Javascript** knowledge.
 
### My codwars task:

```
const sumSquareEvenRootOdd = ns => {
  let sum=0;

for (let k in ns){
  
  if (ns[k] % 2 ==0) {ns[k]=(ns[k]**2);                     
}; 
  if (ns[k] % 2 !=0) {ns[k]=Math.sqrt(ns[k]);                     
};
  sum+=ns[k];
  
}
  return +sum.toFixed(2);
   
};
```

+ Unfortunately my only experience is rsschool 2020q3 course that i abandoned after a month because of lack of time. 

+ I finished speciality public administration and economy in the Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Republic of Belarus in budgetary form of education.

+ I have **B2** level of English, if 40-minutes online free test can give a presentation of it, and A1 Spanish. Main part of my practice was speaking with people in foreign european counties when i was on vocations and about 2-3 meetings with ambassadors of Latin American countries in University.
